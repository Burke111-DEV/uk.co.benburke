    UK-based software engineer based in the East Midlands - I'm passionate about all things tech. I love learning
    new skills, languages, frameworks, and technologies. I have a particular interest in full-stack web development,
    microcontrollers and electronics, and app development, though I do not limit myself to these. Beyond programming, I
    also enjoy 3D printing and designing 3D models, owning and using multiple FDM and SLA/DLP machines.
    <br>
    <br>Ultimately, I strive to equip myself with as many tools to build cool and exciting projects. I believe that
    technology has the power to transform lives and create positive change.

    <br><b>2023 - Today</b>
    <br>
    Working as a Python Software Engineer on an embedded Linux Human Capital Management solution. I act as the primary
    Python developer, overseeing the continuous development and patching of numerous customer applications. In addition
    to Python development, this role also involves skills in SQL database management, Linux system management, shell
    scripting, and web API interfacing. I occasionally assist with the development of the company’s Android
    applications, and I am the primary maintainer of an internal test server built using Kotlin’s Ktor framework. In
    this role I have also built custom development tools for remote device management using the Angular framework and
    Electron, as well as configuring Gitlab CI/CD pipelines with custom Docker images.
    <br>
    <br><b>2020 - 2021</b>
    <br>Between my second and third stages of study, I was fortunate enough to be accepted to attend a Year-In-Industry
    where I worked at international consultancy company, CGI, as a software engineer. With CGI, I was absorbed into a
    software development team, working using Agile and SCRUM. This role taught me valuable technologies which I still
    use, such as Linux systems and BASH, Powershell, and networking concepts.
    <br>
    <br><b>2018 - 2022</b>
    <br>After completing my course at Bedford College, I was accepted at the University of Kent to study Computer
    Systems Engineering.
    Here, I specialised further in the areas of computer science, programming, electronics, engineering mathematics and
    signal analysis.
    Through my time at university, I was exposed to many more new languages and concepts, including Java, OOP,
    HTML/CSS/JS, databases, SQL, PHP, and Python.
    <br>
    <br><b>2016 - 2018</b>
    <br>In 2016 I enrolled on a college course studying Mechanical, Aeronautical, Electrical, and Electronics
    Engineering at Bedford College.
    This course taught the fundamental principles of a wide scope of engineering in its first year. The second year
    required us to specialise in either Mechanical, Aeronauticala, or Electrical and Electronics, which I chose the
    latter.
    It was here that I discovered my fascination for programming, learning to program PIC16F72 microcontrollers using
    Assembly language, and later Arduino board with C++.
    My time at Bedford College was an invaluable experience, ingraining a holistic understanding of the wider
    engineering industry.
