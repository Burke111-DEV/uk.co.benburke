        Cycloid Generator is a Python script for Fusion 360 which generates Cycloid shapes as sketches that can be used to create 3D cycloidal discs and gears.

    <div class="sect sect-b">
        In the GUI menu, users may configure the cycloid shape for their use. 
        The shape type, number of pins, size of the pin, size of the cycloid, and the smoothness (contraction) may all be configured through this menu.
        <br><br>Additionally, this script will interpolate the curve, sampling at a resolution set by the user through the Complexity field.
        This creates a signficant performance improvement, as it reduces the amount of data in the generated sketch geometry while retaining a functionally accurate shape.

    <div class="sect sect-c">
        Some example use cases for a generated cycloid sketch are to produce 3D models of cycloid discs for use in cycloidal drives, or eccentrically cycloidal gears.
