        The Hand Angles Extraction Tool is a project designed to estimate the angle of rotation for each joint in a user's hand when presented to the camera of a device. 
        Developed using JavaScript and the MediaPipe library, this package employs Machine Learning and trigonometry to calculate approximations for each joint in the hand in real-time by looking at a camera feed.

        This system leverages the MediaPipe Hands machine learning library to process a camera feed and obtain approximate 3D point data for an image of a hand. 
        By performing mathematical computations on the obtained 3D coordinates, the system calculates the joint angles throughout the virtual representation of the hand in real-time. 
        Although not highly accurate, this project offers a quick and easy-to-use package for extracting hand pose data from a camera feed.
